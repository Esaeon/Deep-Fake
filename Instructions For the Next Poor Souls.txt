Alright, for those that have taken this project over the semester, we wish you luck.
To the best of our effort, we have documented this code for you to look at.

It should run fine on Windows, although Mac and Linux will have problems with this.
At the very least, try to find a Mac version of Pillow.

We will leave the faceswapping of both photo and video for you to implement into this code. (faceswapping_in_8_steps)
