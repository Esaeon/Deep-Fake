Pillow is no longer needed!

Currently, this version is 0.1.2, considering that images are now able
to be displayed on Graphics Windows. The Graphics Windows package is included
so there is no need to worry.

File Dialog is also a handy tool that asks for the file name of the image
one wants to load. That Python package is also included.

The Python Version needs to be at least 3.10; otherwise you will run into a syntax error with match-case, Python's version of switch-cases.

DeepFake v0.1.3 is here!

Pillow is now needed; HOWEVER, I managed to get Pillow into Github itself
so you (hopefully) do not need to install it! Yaaaay!

Images are now able to show themselves before proceeding with the rest of the code...once I manage to program that in.
