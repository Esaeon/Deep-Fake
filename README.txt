Pillow is no longer needed!

Currently, this version is 0.1.2, considering that images are now able
to be displayed on Graphics Windows. The Graphics Windows package is included
so there is no need to worry.

File Dialog is also a handy tool that asks for the file name of the image
one wants to load. That Python package is also included.
