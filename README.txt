Before you run this code, please keep in mind that the current version
RUNS ON PILLOW. To do so, go through the following:

Go to this site: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html;
Instead of "python" or "python3" being used, use "py". Everything else is as written.

We will try and find a way to display images without using Pillow in the future.
